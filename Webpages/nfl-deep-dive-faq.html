                <h6>1. What is a "salary cap"?</h6>
                <p>A salary cap is the maximum amount of money a team can pay its players in a given year. In 2017, the
                  cap was $167
                  million; in 2021 the cap was 182.5 million. The cap is not necessarily the same for every team in a
                  given year, since unspent cap from the previous year is rolled over to the next.</p>

              <div class="pt-2">
                <h6>2. What does "cap hit" mean?</h6>
                <p>a player’s cap hit is determined as the average annual value of their current contract. A player’s
                  cap hit is not necessarily how much they are paid in a given year, but how much they will count
                  against a team’s salary cap during that season.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="pt-2">
                <h6>3. What is "dead cap" or "dead money"?</h6>
                <p>When a player is cut or traded, this is the guaranteed money left on a player’s contract at the time
                  they were let go. Teams attempt to avoid too much "dead money" in their salary caps. But dead money is
                  simply a sunk cost.</p>
