# February 6, 2022: Planning Notes 

## Questions:  
- Does arrest record have an impact on success rate?  
- Success rate = rate of win vs loss (>.500 or made playoffs)  
- Does TBIs have an impact on arrest record?  
- Does weather during games have an impact on TBIs?  
- What position wind up with the most TBIs?  
- Average lifespan with those with TBIs?  
 
## Hypothesis:  
- Hypothesis 1: Criminal behavior impacts the success of the team  
- Hypothesis 2: CTE has a direct impact team success.  
- Hypothesis 3: There is a direct correlation between CTE and criminal behavior in NFL athletes.  
 
## Machine Learning:    
- Can we predict based on the number of CTEs a player has if they will engage in criminal activity  
- Does criminal activity help identify individual who have CTEs
