## Topic: 
We have all seen the headlines regarding NFL players committing crimes only to find out after they have passed away that they suffered from CTE (Chronic Trauma Encephalopathy). Team Dain Bramage began to wonder is there a relationship in NFL players between concussive injury with criminal behavior and can we predict which players may be arrested for criminal behavior.

- [Kristina Engle]()
- [Pam Norman]()
- [Dan Prenevost]()
- [Kari Suchy]()

## Question(s)  
- Is there a strong correlation between players with concussions and criminal behavior?
- Can we predict which players may be arrested based on the data we have? 
- Is there a connection between the players position and concussion / arrest rate?
- Is there a connection between the team, concussions and criminal behavior?
