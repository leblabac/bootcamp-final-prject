## Topic: 
"We hear fans scream about pampered athletes all the time. They complain that players are paid exorbitant amounts and treated like rock stars. The average person has a vision of a mega-rich lifestyle with easy money, fast cars and behavior unencumbered by the norms of polite society." Indeed, the National Football League (NFL) is the most popular professional sport in America with annual league revenues of just over 15.26 billion in 2019. The League distributed $9.5 billion to its 32 teams, so each team individually brought in $296 million last year. (Kelly 2020)

Beyond the images of pampered athletes, however, is the time-honored race to **WIN** - and (owners notwithstanding) many people have a team they're invested in the winning outcome of.  Team Dain Bramage began to wonder about the relationship between money allocation and winning.

## Questions  
- Does salary cap allocation across individual team members affect team ability to win?

## Hypothesis
When salaries are more evenly distributed among the teams players, the team experiences more wins.
