## Topic: 
Sensationalist headlines report NFL players committing crimes only to discover post-mortem that the player suffered from Chronic Trauma Encephalopathy (CTE). Team Dain Bramage began to wonder is there a relationship in NFL players between concussive injury with criminal behavior and can we predict which players may be arrested for criminal behavior.

## Hypothesis
There is a correlation between concussions and criminal behavior in NFL players. 

## Questions  
- Is there a strong correlation between players with concussions and criminal behavior?
- Can we predict which players may be arrested based on the data we have? 
- Is there a connection between the player's position / game statistics and concussion / arrest rate?
- Is there a connection between the team, concussions and criminal behavior?
- Blah, blah, blah

## Machine Learning
Utilize multi-linear regression model with a target variable of number of arrests.
